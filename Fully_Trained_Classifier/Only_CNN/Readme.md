# Purpose

To make a combined python notebook, in which we can add our model, then run it.
Currently, it uses a very simple CNN model.

# Run
The ipynb notebook is what you can directly run.

# Just CNN model. Trained on Google Colab using GPU. Takes 1-1.5 hours maximum.

# Trained with 50% of data and tested on 50% of data.

# Accuracy 0.69/1 = 0.69%, Cohen kappa score 0.38/1 = 0.38%

# Performs better than random.

Confusion matrix:
