## Pytorch_Attention_COMP_5331_Ayush.ipynb

Added basic code of Fusion sub network, exact depends on Pixel and Frequency domain. Please refer to the additional links provided to better understand how to integrate it. This one was initially designed for RNN, for seq2seq modeling.

Let me know if you encounter any difficulties.
