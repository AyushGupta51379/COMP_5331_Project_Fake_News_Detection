# Here are our Baseline models and Sequential model of CNN

### VGG16, VGG19 and InceptionV3 are in Baselines Folder

### Sequential models of CNN are in Sequential_of_CNN Folder

#### We experimented with number of CNN layers = 1,2,3,4.

The codes are present in their respective folders.

# How to run the code?

### They are all Python notebooks: Run via Jupyter notebook or by Uploading to Google Colab.

The codes will use internet, publically available Image data set. You do not need to worry about it. Just run the code, on a GPU. 

Since they are already interactive notebooks, you can easily see their code with outputs.

### Use GPU as the training needs GPU.

Training time is generally within 30 minutes to 90 minutes, while using a Google Colab GPU.
