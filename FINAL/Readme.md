# 2 folders - BASELINE and MVNN

### Baseline folder contains Baselines models of VGG16,VGG19 and the Sequential models of CNN.

### MVNN folder contains MVNN model and its different variations.

# How to run the code?

### They are all Python notebooks: Run via Jupyter notebook or by Uploading to Google Colab.

The codes will use internet, publically available Image data set. You do not need to worry about it. Just run the code, on a GPU. 

Since they are already interactive notebooks, you can easily see their code with outputs.

### Use GPU as the training needs GPU.

Training time is generally within 30 minutes to 90 minutes, while using a Google Colab GPU.
